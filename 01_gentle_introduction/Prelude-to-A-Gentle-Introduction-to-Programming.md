# Prelude to ‚ÄúA Gentle Introduction to Programming!‚Äù
Tomorrow we‚Äôre going to start with a gentle introduction to programming!

It can be difficult to learn how to code, mainly because modern programming languages do SO MUCH that it‚Äôs often overwhelming for newcomers. To help mitigate this, we‚Äôll be using a very simple language and environment called ‚ÄúKarel‚Äù to learn basic coding concepts this week. Karel was developed at Stanford University to help teach first year computer scientist students. Stanford has arguably the top Computer Science department in the world, so we‚Äôll be using the same approach in our classroom right here at Array! üôÇ 


## What is Karel?!?

Karel is a simple robot living in a simple world, and it comes with several basic commands which we‚Äôll cover in the morning! We‚Äôll use a simple programming language which looks a LOT like JavaScript to tell Karel what to do. 

For tonight, I just want you to install the Karel programming environment so that we‚Äôre all ready to start learning how to code in the morning! In order to run Karel code on our laptops, we need to install the Java SDK (Software Development Kit). 

Download the following file, run it, and follow all instructions on the screen to install the Java SDK:
https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106j/software/jdk-mac.dmg
When you get to the end of the install it will ask if you want to move the downloaded file to the trash, hit ‚ÄúMove to Trash‚Äù as you don‚Äôt need that ~230MB file in your downloads folder anymore!

Great! Now you have the Java environment installed, and while we won‚Äôt be directly writing Java code, many of the tools we use require Java to be installed. Next we need to download the JSKarel package which enables us to write Karel code!

Download this ZIP file:
https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106j/software/JSKarelForMac.zip
Open it up to decompress the ZIP, then move the whole JSKarelForMac folder to your desktop.

Now let‚Äôs make sure everything worked, if you try to just double-click the JSKarel.jar file that is inside that folder MacOS will not let you open it. It complains about the file being from an unknown developer, but anytime this happens you can just right-click the file and select ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù and then confirm that this is what you want by selecting ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù again! If everything worked, you should see this screen after a few seconds:

Now you‚Äôre ready to go for tomorrow morning, and day one of Computer Science Fundamentals! :)
