# Friday JavaScript Challenges

## **Challenge 1**

As mathematical historians have told the story, the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777‚Äì1855) began to show his mathematical talent at a very early age. When he was in primary school, Gauss was asked by his teacher to compute the sum of the first 100 integers. Gauss is said to have given the answer instantly by working out that the sum of the first N integers is given by the formula

Write a function **sumFirstNIntegers** that takes the value of N as its argument and returns the sum of those integers, as illustrated in the following sample run:

## **Challenge 2**

Using the **celsiusToFahrenheit** function on page 50 as a model, write the function **fahrenheitToCelsius** that converts a temperature value in the opposite direction. The conversion formula is

In Orwell‚Äôs novel, Syme and his colleagues at the Ministry of Truth are engaged in simplifying English into a more regular language called Newspeak. As Orwell describes in his appendix entitled ‚ÄúThe Principles of Newspeak,‚Äù words can take a variety of prefixes to eliminate the need for the massive number of words we have in English. For example, Orwell writes

Define three functions‚Äî**negate**, **intensify**, and **reinforce**‚Äîthat take a string and add the prefixes **"un"**, **"plus"**, and **"double"** to that string, respectively. Your function definitions should allow you to generate the following console session:
